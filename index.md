## Wow

You finally did it, Leo. You signed up and started a blog.

Past you would have been terrified at the prospect of having to *write* stuff and *publish* it for all eyes to see and critique. After all, one of the original attractions of mathematics in school was that you wouldn't ever have to spend evenings writing 3 sides of A4 on Catherine de Bourgh from Pride and Prejudice (good for you Elizabeth for sticking it to her).

Times have changed. At the time of writing, you might still be nervous about this prospect - that's totally fine. You might not realise it, but you have indeed written documents, dissertations and presentations that have been helpful and interesting at best, and average and acceptable at worst. Not a bad start!

Hopefully you can use this platform to articulate your thoughts and feelings, tracking your progress as you go along. Your objective will be to be a better writer than you were yesterday, last week, last year. Most importantly, __you are not being graded__. This is purely for your pleasure and that of those that stumble upon it, to discover, understand, empathise, and challenge. Write what you like, and what you feel. If someone sees it and likes it, it's a bonus.

Maybe your objectives will evolve over time, but this will do for now.

Well done on taking the first step.

See you in the future!
